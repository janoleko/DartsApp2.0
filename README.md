# {DartsOptimizeR}

Me and my uni-friends recently started playing darts. As we are quite bad (i.e. our throws have a large standard deviation) we asked ourselves if it is better to aim at the bullseye or triple twenty. Then generalized the question even more: Depending on your skill level, what target should you choose to maximize your expected points on three darts?

The code provided here can be used to answer this question. It enables the user to efficiently calculate the expected score based on the standard deviations estimated from entered throws. For details, see Tibshirani et al. (2010).
